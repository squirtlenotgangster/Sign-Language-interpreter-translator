📘 Sign Language Images Dataset

A curated collection of images representing sign language gestures. This dataset is intended for use in machine learning, computer vision research, educational tools, and accessibility-focused applications.

🗂️ Project Overview

This repository contains labeled images of sign language gestures. The primary goal is to support researchers and developers in building models that can recognize sign language signs accurately and help advance accessible communication technologies.

Folder Details:

A, B, C… – Folders containing images of hand signs representing letters (or specific gestures).

OtherSigns – Non-alphabet signs (e.g., numbers, special signs, dynamic gestures captured as frames).

Metadata/labels.csv – Contains image names along with corresponding labels.

🏷️ Labels

The dataset currently includes the following types of labels:

Alphabet signs (A–Z)

Numeric signs (0–9) (optional if included)

Custom gestures

Metadata fields such as:

image_id

label

sign_type (static or dynamic)

hand_used (left, right, both)

lighting_conditions or any other notes as applicable

If you'd like me to generate a sample labels.csv, just ask!

🖼️ Image Specifications
