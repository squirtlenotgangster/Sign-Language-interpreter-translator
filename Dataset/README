🧪 Data Collection Process

Describe how the data was collected:

Devices used (camera, phone, Kinect, etc.)

Recording conditions (lighting, background, frame rate)

Participant diversity

Annotation process

Example:

Videos were recorded at 1080p, 30 FPS in controlled indoor lighting. Each sign was performed by multiple participants to capture variation in hand shape, movement, and expression.

🏷️ Labels & Annotation

Provide details about your labeling system:

Alphabet (A–Z)

Numbers (0–9)

Common words (e.g., “Hello”, “Yes”, “Thank you”)

Gloss format if applicable

Annotation tools used (CVAT, LabelImg, custom scripts, etc.)

💡 Usage
Python Example (Images)
import cv2
import os

path = "dataset/train/class_1"
for img in os.listdir(path):
    image = cv2.imread(os.path.join(path, img))
    cv2.imshow("Sample", image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)

PyTorch DataLoader Example
from torchvision import datasets, transforms

transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
    transforms.ToTensor()
])

dataset = datasets.ImageFolder("dataset/train", transform=transform)

🚀 Applications

Sign language recognition models

Real-time interpreter systems

Pose estimation and gesture control

Augmented and virtual reality accessibility tools
