# Sign-Language-interpreter-translator
A modular sign language interpretation and translation system combining computer vision, sequence modelling, and natural language processing. It aims to bridge communication between deaf and hearing communities by converting sign language gestures to text and speech, and optionally translating that text into other spoken languages.
